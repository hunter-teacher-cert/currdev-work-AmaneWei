Develop two assignments that are different types for your unit plan.
Describe the assignment, including student facing instructions in a markdown file. Save this file in your own personal work repository.
This is individual work, that can be incorperated into your unit plan later.

Game Development Unit

First Assignment
Regular (daily) homework/small individual work
We want students to develop a game developer's mind so we'd go over some popular old games like pong and space invaders. We'll have fun and play some together in class. Then on their own, they would jot down things that they notice- game play mechanics, graphics, sound, etc. I'd also ask them to include what they liked and not like in the game, and how it can be improved.
Since they have played a game and this is a unit after learning most programming units, I'd ask them to write down what they think they'll have to use in order to duplicate the game. Ex: while loops for the game run, conditional statements for some gameplay, for loops for detecting walls, etc.



Second assignment 
Open-ended project
Students will work in groups to make a small and simple game
Each student will assign themselves a role:
1. designer
2. artist
3. storyboard/writer
And of course, everyone is the programmer/developer

Note: We would have gone over GUI and 2D graphics
The game will have a rubric that requires them to make a diagram.  The diagram should show or explain how each image is going to move.  The win/loss conditions should be clearly stated.  
This project will probably be 2 weeks long+
