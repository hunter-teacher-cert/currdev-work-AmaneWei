## Assignment
* title: **04_langauge.md**
  * Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)
  * Answer the following prompts:
    - What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
    AP CSP, for students juniors and above
    Most students have some sort of background knowledge in CS
        - Some come from Intro to Java or Intro to Scratch and Python
    However, this course is open to anyone regardless of CS background

    - What is the language?
    Processing

    - How does one write & run code in this language?
    It looks like its an online IDE like replit that allows you to code and compile in their own editor. However, you download the software on to your computer like a regular IDE and code in its editor. It's interesting because you 'sketch' instead of run because the code creates a visual image. 
      
    - Rate the complexity of the syntax?
    To be honest, I thought this would be kind of complex, given to students with some CS background but a group member said that its the perfect gateway for students who don't have any knowledge to get into CS. Just by looking at the language, there are clear syntax and rules that students need to learn first before even understanding the content and coding. 

    - Strengths
    It gives visuals
    Some students aren't motivated when it's purely text-based but with this software sketchbook, it teaches fundamental programming with visuals. This is great for visual learners and motivates/engages students into coding. The more I look into this software, I see that it was designed to be as simple as possible so that it could benefit newer students. 

    - How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
    Starting class out with showing projects of what they could do and achieve in this course. Any student at home can download and install easily and has many tutorials that students can follow along or learn at their own pace. It is also straightforward and easy to learn and use. 
    
      
    - Weaknesses
    Students who want to do higher-level programming won't be able to create those crazy games that they've always dreamed of doing. Most of my CS students want to create games so I don't think processing allows them to do what they imagine they can do. It's only good for art work, but they'll need much more if they want an actual GUI.

    - How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
    Probably have students make visual-novel like games and help them move into Python and Java for next year's course. Most students will take another CS class the next year, so this will help in that.

    - Why did you select this language for this class?
    I've heard about this from students and it seems like they knew of this already. I was not familiar with it but they gave me a quick explanation in class one day. Because of this, I became interested when it was brought up in this class.
