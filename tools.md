Desribe 2 technological tools you currently use in your classroom. One of which should be a programming tool (if possible). 
The two technology tools that I use everyday with students are Netbeans and Google Classroom. I've trained my students to open both everyday for class.


Techology 1: Netbeans IDE

- What its general purpose is: Allows students to code Java on an IDE software.
- The class(es) you use it in: Intro to Java Honors and AP CSA
- How you use it in class: I use this as the main IDE for our class. It is used as a coding environment and every student codes using this. Most students will code independently but will have discussion about their code.
- Why you have selected that tool for that purpose? Netbeans is easy to use for beginners and free to install. It has inbuilt libraries has some shortcuts to complete code segments like sout for System.out.println(). It also helps simulates the industry in which files are saved on folders in the desktop (locally).



Techology 2: Google Classroom

- What its general purpose is: A learning platform that I am using to help my plan, create, post, and grade student assignments.
- The class(es) you use it in: All my classes (CS)
- How you use it in class: I can upload assignments in organized topics. They can make copies of files for students to write and edit in. Students can upload their .java file there and leave private messages. It also has a rubric system where I can create rubrics and distribute points by clicking on buttons- it also tells students how I graded them.
- Why you have selected that tool for that purpose: It's free and super easy to use. It can be accessed online via cell phone and any computer. It's a platform that share files and makes grading super easy!
