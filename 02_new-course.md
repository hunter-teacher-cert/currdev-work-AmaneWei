Where it fits along with the other courses in your school
In our school, we have two tracks for students

1. Carl Sagan Honors Program
  > Students in this honors program has 4 tracks to choose from, where one of them is computer science. If they take this course, they will do this
  > Sophmore - Intro to Java Honors
  > Juniors - AP CSA
  > Seniors - AP CSP or Intro to Electrical Engineering or Robotics Team

2. Non-Carl Sagan
  >  These students basically could do the same track as the Carl Sagan students except they could take Intro to TEALS (Snap/Python) as a freshmen if they took Algebra 1 in middle school

This Gaming Development course could be a class that you could take as an option if you continue to and want to take more CS courses
