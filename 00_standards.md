Describe the components and design characteristics that allow data and information to be moved, stored and referenced over the Internet.

AP CSP's activities in The Internet have an internet simulator that show students how to design and create networks that sends data over to the internet. They should have learned a point-to-point communication and now they can setup to broadcast messages in the simulator room and address IP addresses.

Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.

AP CSP's programming have a lesson about progrject designing in which students yse pair programming to create code based on a program specification. We use a planning guide to help students plan an app that they can use to solve some sort of community problem.
